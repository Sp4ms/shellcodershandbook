### readme.txt Contents:
This zip contains sample code for The Shellcoder's Handbook, 2nd Edition. You may notice that Chapters 6, 10, 14, 15, 18, 21, 23, and 25 are not included. The authors believe that in these chapters there isn't anything that's really worth splitting out as seperate files. As with the book itself, we hope you have fun with the sample code we have included and that you find it useful and informative. Thanks.
